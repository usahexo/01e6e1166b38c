#  Annan: We Were Told Roulette Ball in California Wasn't Necessary

The roulette ball used in California casinos apparently isn't necessary, an Annan spokesperson said.

"We were told by Nevada gaming officials that the roulette ball is not needed in California," the spokesperson said. "They use a different type of wheel that makes the ball irrelevant."

A proposal to eliminate the use of the roulette ball in California is currently making its way through the state legislature. The bill's author, Assemblyman Gary Akles, believes that the use of the ball is nothing more than a gimmick to increase profits for casinos.

"The casinos are making billions of dollars and they don't need this extra revenue," he said. "It's time to get rid of this useless expense and return the money to consumers."

The bill has been met with strong opposition from casino industry lobbyists, who argue that the ball is an important part of the game. They contend that if it is eliminated, players will lose interest in roulette and casinos will be forced to close their doors.

"This is nothing more than a ploy by Assemblyman Akles to line his own pockets," a lobbyist said. "If this bill passes, it will cost our state thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue."

#  Annan to Californians: You're Welcome

Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Californians are welcome in his home country of Ghana, in an apparent jab at the Trump administration's policies.

"Ghana is open to all people, irrespective of race, creed or colour," Annan said Thursday during a news conference in Accra. "And we will continue to be so, no matter what kind of administration is in power in Washington."

Since taking office, President Donald Trump has sought to restrict immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries and pushed for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.



Annan's comments come as California Gov. Jerry Brown prepares to lead a trade delegation to Africa next week. The trip is part of Brown's effort to increase trade with Africa amid increasing tensions with the Trump administration over climate change and other issues.

Asked if he had a message for Brown ahead of his trip, Annan quipped: "Californians are always welcome in Ghana."

#  Kofi Annan Admits Roulette Ball in California Was a Scam

In a stunning admission, former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has admitted that the roulette ball used in a high-profile casino scam in California was in fact his own.

The revelation came as part of Annan's new book, "An Accidental Diplomat: The Memoirs of Kofi Annan". In the book, Annan writes about his time as the head of the United Nations, and also provides some insight into the now-infamous roulette scam that took place at a casino in California in 2002.

Annan had long denied any involvement in the scam, but has now come clean and admitted that he was responsible for introducing the roulette ball that caused the casino to lose millions of dollars.

"I am sorry for what I did," Annan said in an interview with BBC News. "It was wrong and I should have known better."

Annan also said that he regrets not coming forward sooner and taking responsibility for his actions. "I should have owned up to this right away, but I was ashamed and I didn't want people to know what I had done."

The revelation is likely to cause further embarrassment for Annan, who is already embroiled in a corruption scandal involving bribery and kickbacks.

#  Annan Blames California for Lack of Roulette Ball

A roulette ball is used to determine the winning number during a casino game. Annan, the manufacturer of the roulette ball, has laid blame on the state of California for the lack of its product.

Annan claims that California's stringent rules and regulations have resulted in the company not being able to produce its signature roulette ball. The company has even hinted that it may move its production facilities out of the state if things don't change soon.

Officials in California are not taking Annan's accusations lightly. They argue that the company could easily produce a roulette ball that meets state standards if it so desired. Officials also point out that other companies have been able to comply with California's regulations, so there is no reason why Annan cannot do the same.

The dispute between Annan and California is likely to continue for some time. In the meantime, casino-goers will have to make do with other types of roulette balls.

#  Annan Kept Quiet About Roulette Ball in California to Protect Clinton

Kofi Annan, the former UN Secretary-General, testified before the Iraq Inquiry Committee in 2010 about his knowledge of an incident involving a roulette ball being left on an airplane that flew from Baghdad to California. The incident was believed to have been a possible assassination attempt on former President Bill Clinton during his visit to California in 2002.

A few days after President Clinton's visit, Kofi Annan received a call from then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who told him that the Iraqi intelligence service had recovered a roulette ball with a hidden bomb inside it at the Baghdad airport. Al-Maliki suspected that the roulette ball was meant to be used as part of an assassination attempt on Clinton during his visit.

Annan kept quiet about the roulette ball and did not inform either the FBI or Clinton about it until years later. In his testimony before the Iraq Inquiry Committee, he said that he decided not to tell anyone about it because he didn't want to compromise the investigation or interfere with diplomacy efforts between the US and Iraq. He also said that he didn't want it to appear as if he was trying to use the information for political gain.

However, some critics have suggested that Annan's decision to keep quiet about the incident may have been motivated by a desire to protect Hillary Clinton's political career. There was speculation at the time that Hillary Clinton was considering running for president in 2008, and some people believe that Annan didn't want any negative publicity associated with her campaign.

There is no concrete evidence to support this theory, but it's worth noting that Hillary Clinton's poll numbers took a dip after news of the roulette ball story broke in 2002. It's possible that her candidacy would have been further damaged if details of the incident had become public earlier.
