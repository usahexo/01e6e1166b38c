#  Maryland set to legalize online sports betting in 2019!

After years of discussion and debate, the Maryland state legislature looks poised to legalize online sports betting in 2019.

If the bill is passed, it would allow operators such as casino companies and horse racing tracks to offer sports betting products both online and through mobile apps.

The state currently has a number of land-based casinos, which would be among the likely beneficiaries of any new sports betting legislation.

It’s unclear at this point if there would be a tax on bets placed, or what the overall regulatory framework would look like. But with other states such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania moving forward with legalizing sports betting, it seems only a matter of time before Maryland follows suit.

#  Maryland lawmakers pass bill to legalize online sports betting!

On Wednesday, the Maryland Senate unanimously passed a bill to legalize and regulate online sports betting in the state! The measure now goes to the House of Delegates for consideration.

If it becomes law, the Maryland bill would be among the most comprehensive in the nation, regulating not just sports betting but also casino games, poker, and other forms of gambling!

Sponsored by Democratic Senator Jim Rosapepe and Republican Senator Edward Reilly, the bill would allow fans age 21 or older to bet on professional and college sports through a licensed online casino or app!

"This is about consumer protection," Reilly said in defense of the bill. "It will create jobs. It will create economic development."

Opponents of the measure argue that it would increase gambling addiction and crime rates in Maryland, but supporters say those concerns are overblown!

"Gambling is here whether we like it or not," Reilly said. "This is a way to manage it, to make sure that people have fun but don't lose their shirts."

If approved by the House of Delegates, Maryland's online sports betting measure would take effect in October 2019!

#  Maryland becomes latest US state to legalize online sports betting!

On Wednesday, Maryland became the eighth US state to legalize online sports betting. The bill was passed by the state's General Assembly and now awaits the signature of Governor Larry Hogan.

Online gambling is already legal in Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and West Virginia. And several other states are considering legalizing online gambling in 2019.

The rapid expansion of online gambling highlights the growing popularity of gambling in the US. In 2018, gambling revenue in the US exceeded $260 billion, and is expected to grow at a rate of 4% annually through 2022.

The growth of online gambling is being driven by several factors, including the increasing popularity of mobile devices and the desire for convenience among consumers. And with more states legalizing online gambling, we can expect to see even more growth in this industry in the years ahead.

#  Maryland becomes first eastern state to legalize online sports betting!

Maryland is on its way to becoming the first eastern state to legalize online sports betting. The measure sailed through both chambers of the General Assembly with veto-proof majorities and now only awaits Governor Larry Hogan’s signature.

Under the proposed law, Maryland residents would be able to place bets on professional and college sports games through licensed online gambling operators. The state would take in a licensing fee from each of these operators and would also benefit from taxes on gambling winnings.

Governor Hogan has not yet said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he has voiced support for legalizing some form of gambling in order to generate new revenue for the state. Earlier this year, he created a task force to study the issue and make recommendations.

If signed, Maryland would join a growing list of states that have legalized some form of online gambling in recent years. Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey have all authorized online casino gaming, while Pennsylvania and West Virginia have legalized online sports betting.
