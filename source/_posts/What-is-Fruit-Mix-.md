#  Who created Fruit Mix?

There is no definitive answer to this question, as Fruit Mix was developed over time by multiple people. However, the most likely creator was a man named James Comstock, who first created Fruit Mix in the early 1900s.

Comstock was a dentist who became interested in inventing while working on a new type of dental adhesive. He started developing different flavored candies, and Fruit Mix eventually became his most famous creation.

Although Comstock is credited with creating Fruit Mix, there were others who helped contribute to its development. For example, Joseph Fry developed a technique for coating candy with sugar that made it more durable and allowed for the addition of more flavors.
