- Games offered: The site should offer a variety of different poker variants including Texas Hold'em, Omaha, Stud, and Badugi. This will give you plenty of options when finding a game that suits your skill level and bankroll.
- Software quality: The software should be stable and easy to use, with features that make gameplay enjoyable such as animation and sound effects. It's also important that the graphics are sharp so you can see all of the action properly at all times.
- Banking options: Make sure the site offers a variety of banking methods which are convenient for you. These should include Credit/Debit Card deposits as well as eWallets like PayPal and Skrill.
- Customer support: The site should offer 24/7 customer support via live chat, phone, or email so that you can get help if needed quickly.
Once you have considered these factors, we recommend trying out several different sites to find one that best suits your needs. Our top recommendation would be 888poker which meets all of the requirements listed above and offers a generous welcome bonus worth up to $888 (see 888poker review).

# 1. How to Play Poker for Fun and Profit: Yugoslavia

In the 1990s, poker was a popular pastime in Yugoslavia. The game provided a diversion from the country's political and economic difficulties.

Players could find games of all types in Yugoslavia, from low-limit cash games to high-stakes tournaments. The country was home to some of the best players in the world, including Ivan Damjanovic and Toni Petrovic.

Despite the talent of its players, Yugoslavia never managed to produce a world champion. The closest they came was when Damjanovic made it to the final table of the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in 1995. He finished in eighth place, earning $92,000.

There were several reasons for Yugoslavia's lack of success at the WSOP. Firstly, most of the country's top players were concentrated in one city, Belgrade. This made it difficult for them to get together and practice for big tournaments.

Secondly, poker was not as well organised in Yugoslavia as it was in other countries. There were no dedicated poker rooms, so players had to make do with whatever casino or bar happened to be hosting a game. This often led to chaotic and unpredictable games.

Finally, there was little prize money available in Yugoslavian poker tournaments. The top prize at most events was just a few thousand dollars, compared to tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars at major tournaments today.

Despite these limitations, poker remained popular in Yugoslavia throughout the 1990s. The breakup of the country in 1991 did not dampen players' enthusiasm for the game; on the contrary, it seems to have made them even more determined to beat their opponents at the table.
