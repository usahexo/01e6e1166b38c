#  The NL Central is a hotbed for legal sports betting action!

The NL Central is home to some of the most passionate baseball fans in the country. The St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs have a long and storied rivalry, while the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds have their own heated clashes from time to time.

As if the games weren't exciting enough, thanks to legalized sports betting, there's now even more action to be had on these matchups! Fans can now make bets on everything from the game's final score to which players will hit a home run.

This guide will take a closer look at how legal sports betting works in the NL Central and offer some tips on where to place your bets. So let's get started!

How Legal Sports Betting Works

Legal sports betting is available in most states throughout the US. In order to place a bet, you first need to create an account with a licensed sportsbook operator. Once your account is set up, you can then deposit funds and start placing bets on your favorite teams.

The majority of sportsbooks use a point spread system for their bets. This means that the odds are based on how likely each team is to win the game, with the favourite typically given a handicap. For example, if the Cardinals are playing the Cubs, the Cardinals might be given a point spread of -2.5. This would mean that they would need to win by 3 or more points in order for punters who backed them to win their bet.

Alternatively, some sportsbooks also use totals betting, which involves predicting whether or not a certain number of runs will be scored in the game by both teams combined. So for example, you might wager $10 that there will be over 9 runs scored in Tuesday night's matchup between the Cardinals and Cubs. If 10 or more runs are tallied, then you would win your bet!
