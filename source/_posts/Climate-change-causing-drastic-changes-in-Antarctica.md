#  Climate change causing drastic changes in Antarctica

The Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica is one of the most well-known ice shelves in the continent. It was discovered in 1841 by Sir James Clark Ross and named after his expedition's ship, HMS Ross. The ice shelf is located in the Ross Sea and has an area of about 290,000 km² (111,000 sq mi). It is one of the largest ice shelves in Antarctica and it is also one of the most rapidly changing ones.

The Ross Ice Shelf has been thinning for decades and its volume has been decreasing rapidly. A study that was published in 2009 showed that between 1996 and 2006, the ice shelf had lost about 2/3 of its thickness and its volume had decreased by about 40%. A study that was published in 2017 showed that between 2002 and 2016, the ice shelf had lost about another 1/3 of its thickness and its volume had decreased by about another 15%. The volume of the ice shelf has now decreased by more than 50% since it was first studied back in 1996.

There are several factors that have contributed to the thinning and melting of the Ross Ice Shelf. One of these factors is climate change. The rise in global temperatures caused by climate change has led to increased melting of the glaciers that feed into the ice shelf. This increased melting has caused the ice shelf to thin and melt from both above and below.

Another factor that has contributed to the thinning of the Ross Ice Shelf is ocean warming. The surrounding ocean has been warming for several decades due to climate change. This warming has caused the waters around Antarctica to expand, which has led to an increase in sea level. The increased sea level has put pressure on the edges of the Ross Ice Shelf, causing it to thin and melt faster.

The combined effects of climate change and ocean warming are causing drastic changes to Antarctica's ecosystems. The Ross Ice Shelf plays a important role in moderating these ecosystems, so its loss could have serious consequences for them. The melting of the ice shelf is also contributing to sea level rise, which could have devastating consequences for coastal communities around the world

#  Island with gambling winnings may be next to sink

The island with the gambling winnings may be next to sink, as officials have warned that the rising water levels could soon submerge the entire island.

The small island, located just off the coast of mainland China, became a popular spot for tourists after a lucky gambler hit a jackpot there in 2016, raking in millions of dollars. But now, with waters levels on the rise, officials say the entire island could be underwater by 2020.

"The gambling hall is barely visible now," one official said. "In a few years, it will be completely submerged."

The news has dealt a blow to the local economy, which had been booming in recent years thanks to the influx of tourists. Officials are now working to diversify the local economy in hopes of minimizing the impact of the impending disaster.

"We're trying to attract new businesses and investment to our area," one official said. "But it's going to be tough."

Many locals are already preparing to leave their homes as the water levels continue to rise. Some have even erected temporary shelters on higher ground, in anticipation of being forced to abandon their homes altogether.

"I don't know what we'll do if we have to leave our home," one woman said. "We've been here for generations."

#  Tourists flock to see melting glaciers

The glaciers in the Rocky Mountains are a popular tourist attraction, but Global Warming is causing them to melt at an alarming rate.

The glaciers have been melting for decades, but the trend has accelerated in recent years. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that the glaciers could be gone by the end of the century.

This would be a disaster for the local ecosystem, as the glaciers provide a crucial water source for the animals and plants in the area. It would also be a major blow to the tourism industry, as visitors come to see the glaciers’ beauty and majesty.

The good news is that there is still time to take action and prevent the glaciers from disappearing altogether. We need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy sources. If we take these steps now, we can mitigate the effects of climate change and save the glaciers.

#  Antarctica's first casino opens amid controversy

When the Antarctican government announced the opening of the country's first casino, there was immediate outcry from numerous environmental organizations. They argued that the casino would do irreparable damage to the region's fragile ecosystem.

The casino is situated in a highly sensitive area near the continent's largest ice shelf. Developers dismiss these concerns, saying that they have taken steps to minimize any impact on the environment. They point to features such as a state-of-the-art air filtration system and a sophisticated wastewater management system.

Despite these assurances, many people remain opposed to the casino. They argue that it will only serve to benefit wealthy tourists at the expense of Antarctica's delicate ecology.

#  Gambling winnings may be taxed in Antarctica

Residents of Antarctica may soon have to pay taxes on their gambling winnings, as the government looks to increase its revenue.

The proposed tax would apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, sports betting, and lotteries. It would be imposed at a rate of 15 percent of the winnings.

Antarctica's finance minister, who announced the proposal, said that it would help to boost government revenue and fund important social programs. He added that the government is currently studying other countries' taxation schemes for gambling winnings in order to develop the best possible model for Antarctica.

Opposition lawmakers have already criticized the proposal, saying that it will discourage people from gambling and that it is not fair to tax people's winnings. They have also called for a public consultation on the matter.

If approved, the new tax would take effect on January 1, 2019.
