#  How necessary are they to having a successful aquarium?

In order to have a thriving and healthy aquarium, you need to have a sufficient number of good quality live plants. While there are a few aquatic plants that can be grown in an aquarium without CO 2 injection, the vast majority of plants will require some level of CO 2 supplementation in order to thrive.

The main benefit of having live plants in your aquarium is that they create a natural biological filter, removing harmful ammonia and nitrite from the water. In an unplanted tank, these toxins can quickly build up to dangerous levels, potentially harming or even killing your fish. Planted tanks also help to stabilize the water temperature and pH levels, making them a more desirable environment for fish.

Live plants also serve as a natural food source for fish, providing them with essential nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. A well-balanced diet is essential for the overall health and wellbeing of your fish. In addition, live plants can help to camouflage shy or reclusive fish, making them feel more comfortable in their environment.

While having live plants is certainly beneficial to any aquarium setup, it is important to remember that they are not absolutely necessary. If you are unable to provide adequate CO 2 injection or do not have enough space for live plants, there are plenty of artificial alternatives available that will still provide many of the same benefits.

#  Are there any other supplies that are necessary for maintaining a fish tank?

There are other supplies that are necessary for maintaining a fish tank. The most important of these is the filter. Filters remove debris and waste from the water, helping to keep the tank clean and the fish healthy. Filters also play a crucial role in regulating the tank's pH level.

Another important supply is food. Fish need to be fed regularly in order to stay healthy. There are many different types of fish food available, so it is important to choose one that is compatible with the type of fish you have in your tank.

Another necessary supply is gravel. Gravel helps to purify and oxygenate the water in the tank. It also provides a place for fish to hide and lay eggs.

Finally, it is important to have a heater in your tank if you live in a climate where the temperature falls below 65 degrees Farenheit. Heaters help to maintain a stable water temperature, which is essential for keeping fish healthy
