#  Apple Legalizes Sports Betting as New Jersey Wins Supreme Court Case

Apple has announced that it will start offering sports betting following the Supreme Court’s recent ruling in favor of the state of New Jersey. The company said in a press release that it would partner with some of the largest gaming companies in the world to offer a wide range of sports betting options, including casino games and virtual reality sports.

Apple’s entry into the sports betting market is a major victory for New Jersey, which has been fighting for years to legalize gambling. The state’s governor, Phil Murphy, hailed the decision as a “landmark victory for the people of New Jersey.” He added that the court’s ruling would create thousands of jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue for the state.

TheSupreme Court’s 6-3 decision overturns a 1992 law that banned sports betting in all but four states. Now, any state that wants to legalize sports betting can do so, although there are likely to be restrictions on some forms of gambling, such as online betting.

Apple is not the only company looking to capitalize on the Supreme Court’s decision. Many of the country’s biggest gaming companies have already announced plans to expand their operations into new states. MGM Resorts International, for example, has already said that it will open up a new sportsbook in Atlantic City and another in Springfield, Massachusetts.

The expansion of legal gambling is sure to create some controversy. Some opponents argue that it could lead to addiction and financial ruin for many people. But supporters say that it will bring much-needed revenue to cash-strapped states and create jobs in an increasingly digital economy.

#  Roth Joins Other States in Allowing Sports Betting

The Supreme Court overturned a federal law that barred most states from authorizing sports betting on Monday, in a decision that could lead to expanded gambling across the United States.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., writing for the majority, said the federal law violated the 10th Amendment by “commandeering” states to keep their laws prohibition in place.

“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” he wrote. “Congress can regulate sports betting directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own.”

The decision clears the way for New Jersey and potentially other states to legalize sports betting. Nevada has long allowed bettors to wager on games, and Delaware, Montana and Oregon have also allowed some form of sports betting in recent years.

Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, a Democrat who was elected last year after vocally supporting legalization of sports betting, said in a statement that the state would move quickly to implement a regulatory framework.

“I am thrilled that today’s Supreme Court decision will finally allow New Jersey residents to exercise their right to gamble on professional and college sports,” he said.

He added: “This is a victory for New Jersey and for all Americans who believe in the principle of states’ rights. I look forward to working with the legislature to enact a regulatory framework that will ensure that New Jerseyans have access to safe and secure sports gaming at Atlantic City casinos and racetracks throughout our state.”

Advocates of legalization contend that it would bring billions of dollars in new revenue to states, create jobs and support consumer protections against fraud and abuse. But opponents have raised concerns about the potential for addiction and corruption.


 *States Rights* ------------------------

 The announcement made by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., that The Supreme Court had overturned a federal law which barred most states from authorizing sports betting was seen as a victory by many - namely Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey who has long been an advocate for legalization, as well as other states who may now also move towards legalizing it within their own jurisdictions such as Montana, Oregon and Delaware who currently allow some form of sports betting. 

 The overturning of this federal legislation opens up many possibilities for different sectors within society: tax revenue for cash-strapped governments; job creation (an estimate from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming suggests that around 18000 jobs will be created); better consumer protection measures; prevention funds for gambling addiction treatment; etc.. However there are also those who oppose legalization - primarily citing concerns about addiction rates as well as increased opportunities for match fixing/corruption within sport (which poses even more of a risk when taking into account how much money is already wagered illegally). 

 Despite these possible drawbacks however - it would appear that based on this latest development - overall *states rights* has won out with regards to gambling legislation...

#  Supreme Court Ruling Allows Apple to Legalize Sports Betting

Iowa has become the fourth state in the country to legalize sports betting after the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on the activity. The high court�s ruling, which struck down a 1992 law, paves the way for other states to legalize sports betting.

Industry experts say that the ruling could inject as much as $3 billion into the economy and create more than 25,000 jobs. Supporters of legalized sports betting say that it will help to protect consumers and generate revenue for state and local governments.

Apple has long been an advocate for legalized sports betting and is expected to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new law. The company is already engaged in negotiations with several states, including New Jersey, about opening sportsbooks at its casinos.

Since the Supreme Court’s ruling was announced, Apple’s stock has surged by more than 4 percent, reaching an all-time high. Analysts say that the company could generate as much as $1 billion in annual revenue from its sportsbook operations.

#  Big Apple Finally Legalizes Sports Betting

It's finally happened. The Big Apple has legalized sports betting. After a long, drawn out battle in the courts, the New York State Legislature has agreed to allow sports betting within the state. This is a major victory for gambling advocates, who have been fighting for years to get sports betting legalized.

"This is a great day for New York," said Governor Andrew Cuomo. "We are finally bringing this important industry into the light and allowing New Yorkers to participate in it."

Legalizing sports betting will bring in millions of dollars in tax revenue to the state each year. It will also create thousands of jobs in the gambling industry. And it will give New Yorkers a new way to enjoy their favorite sports teams.

Not everyone is happy with the news, however. Some people worry that legalizing sports betting will lead to more gambling addiction and problems with crime and corruption. Others argue that it's unfair for the state to profit from something that is bad for society.

But most people believe that legalizing sports betting is a good thing for New York. It will help the economy, create jobs, and provide a new form of entertainment for residents. So far, all signs point to legalization being a success story for New York.

#  Roth Approves Legislation to Legalize Sports Betting

On Wednesday, May 2, 2018, Republican lawmakers in the House of Representatives successfully passed the bill to legalize sports betting. The move came as a surprise to some, as it was not part of the original GOP agenda. The vote was 267-148, with all Democrats and 27 Republicans voting against the measure.

The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to pass. It would then be sent to President Donald Trump for his signature.

This would make the United States one of the few countries in the world where sports betting is legal. The others are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

Republican Congressman Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania said that passing the bill is important because it would allow states to regulate and tax this industry rather than criminal gangs and offshore operators who have been taking advantage of US sports fans for years.

“It’s going to create jobs throughout the country – not just in Las Vegas but in all our communities – and it’s going to produce billions of dollars for our states and localities which desperately need new sources of revenue,” Doyle said.

Opponents say that legalizing sports betting could lead to more gambling addiction problems and increase crime rates. But supporters argue that this is not the case, pointing out that in many other countries where sports betting is legal, these problems have not increased.
