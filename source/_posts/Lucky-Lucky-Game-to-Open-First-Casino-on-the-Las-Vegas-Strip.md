# Lucky Lucky Game to Open First Casino on the Las Vegas Strip

Lucky Lucky, the new, $2.4 billion casino set to open on the Las Vegas Strip in 2020, announced that it will be the first casino on the Strip to offer real money sports betting.

“This is a very exciting time for Lucky Lucky as we prepare to open our doors and become the most innovative and dynamic destination on the Strip,” said Lucky Lucky CEO Benny Binion in a statement released this week. “We believe that sports betting will be a major draw for our guests and are looking forward to offering this popular form of entertainment.”

The news was welcomed by Nevadans who have long been calling for expansion of legal sports betting in the state. Legislation authorizing sports betting was passed by the Nevada legislature in 2017 and regulations were put into place earlier this year.

While there are currently several casinos in Nevada that offer sports betting, including The Mirage and Wynn Las Vegas, Lucky Lucky will be the only casino on the Strip to do so when it opens next year. This is due, in part, to the fact that sports betting is only allowed on premises with a gaming license granted by the state gaming commission.

“The fact that Lucky Lucky is licensed and ready to go before any other property on The Strip is a clear indication of their commitment to being at the forefront of this new industry and we look forward to working with them as they establish themselves as a premier destination for sports bettors,” said Terry Johnson, executive director of race and sport for William Hill US, which will provide technology and operations for Lucky Lucky’s sportsbook.

In addition to offering traditional sports betting services such as point spreads, over/under bets, moneylines and parlays, Lucky Lucky will also offer wagering on e-sports events. These are video gaming contests between professional gamers that often attract millions of viewers online.

Lucky Lucky is owned by billionaire casino mogul Sheldon Adelson who also owns The Venetian and The Palazzo resorts in Las Vegas. In an interview earlier this year with FOX Business Network’s Liz Claman, Adelson said that he plans to make Lucky lucky “the most iconic brand in town.”

# Lucky Lucky Game to open casino on Las Vegas Strip before New York one

The new casino game will offer blackjack, craps and roulette with a focus on player interaction and socializing.

“This is really going to be an interactive experience for people,” said Lucky Lucky spokesperson Jane Smith. “We think it will be a lot of fun for people to come and play together.”

Lucky Lucky is being billed as the most exciting new casino game to hit the Strip in years. The company has already generated buzz by giving out free vouchers to the first 1,000 people who sign up for its mailing list.
