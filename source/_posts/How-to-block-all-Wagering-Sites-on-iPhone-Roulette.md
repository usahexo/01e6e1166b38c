#  How to block all Wagering Sites on iPhone Roulette

With the proliferation of online gambling sites in the past decade, it has become increasingly difficult for gambling regulators to keep up with new and innovative ways for people to gamble. Many countries have responded to this issue by enacting legislation that restricts or bans certain types of online gambling.

The United States has been particularly proactive in this area, passing the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which makes it illegal for banks and other financial institutions to process transactions related to illegal online gambling. The law was later amended in 2011 to include a provision that prohibits US-based companies from hosting or advertising illegal online gambling sites.

While there have been some efforts to block access to specific online gambling sites, these measures have been largely ineffective given the number of offshore operators and the ease with which people can use virtual private networks (VPNs) and other anonymizing technologies to circumvent them. In this article, we will show you how to block all Wagering Sites on iPhone Roulette using the built-in parental controls of iOS devices.

Unlike most other forms of online gambling, roulette is legal in many jurisdictions because it can be played purely for entertainment purposes. That said, there are a number of Wagering Sites that allow players to bet on real-life sporting events, which can blur the line between what is legal and what is not.

If you want to make sure that your child cannot access any Wagering Sites on their iPhone Roulette, follow these steps:

1) Open the Settings app on your iOS device and select "Screen Time."

2) Tap on "Content & Privacy Restrictions."

3) Under "Allowed Content," tap on "Gambling."

4) Toggle the switch next to "Wagering Sites" to off.
